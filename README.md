# MaximumApples

## Problem Statement

There is an array of people. Everyone starts out with 0 apples but can give unlimited apples. The rules are :

Person A can only give an apply to Person B every 3 months.
Each person can only give one apple a month.

Come up with a schedule so that at the end of a time period (1yr) everyone ends up with the most apples

:)
